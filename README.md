# GWAS_PLINK
Using PLINK and implementing ML methods for GWAS from [Chloe-Agathe Azenott's workshop on efficient biomarker discovery](https://github.com/chagaz/practical-microbiomess-2017).

The aim of this endeavour is to achieve a better understanding of PLINK, learn how machine learning methods may be utilised to identify SNPs, and explore avenues of improvement on suggested future work.
